 * The phone's power while it streams to a PC: its screen ([SCREEN]) or apps
 * in windows of their own ([APPS]). Each says what it wants with [set], and
 * the phone does the most any of them asks for, so neither undoes the other.
 *
 * - While anything streams, a CPU wake lock and a Wi-Fi lock keep the phone
 *   on the network with its screen off. Without them it dozes, misses the
 *   PC's keep-alives, and the PC drops the connection after 8 s; the stream
 *   then restarts every few seconds.
 * - Stay awake keeps the screen on; screen off keeps it on too, with the
 *   panel turned off through Elevated, so apps on the PC keep running.
